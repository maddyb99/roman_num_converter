# Roman NumeralConverter

This is one of my oldest projects which I made in December 2013. 

This was inspired from Google Translate's live translation feature (which was quite a buzz then) and tried to provide live conversions of a Roman number to a Decimal number

I threw in some 480p graphics and animations.
